                The contents of our website have been created with the greatest possible care. However, we cannot
                guarantee
                the contents' accuracy, completeness, or topicality. According to Section 7, paragraph 1 of the TMG
                (Telemediengesetz - German Telemedia Act), we as service providers are liable for our content on these
                pages
                by general laws. However, according to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, we service providers are not obliged
                to
                monitor external information transmitted or stored or investigate circumstances pointing to illegal
                activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
                However, a liability in this regard is only possible from the moment of knowledge of a specific
                infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.

                Our website contains links to external websites, over whose contents we have no control. Therefore, we
                cannot accept any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
                websites
                is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible
                legal
                violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not identified at the time of linking. However,
                permanent monitoring of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without specific indications
                of a
                violation. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
